 - Display a 5-day forecast for the user-provided location 
 - The user should be able to search for a location 
2. **3rd Party API:** Use a 3rd party weather API such as OpenWeatherMap or Weather API for  collecting the weather details. 
3. **Vuetify:** Use the Vuetify library to style your components. Ensure that the application is  responsive and provides a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
